# Apple Watch: HRV & BPM Signal Collection for Hunger vs. Satiety Evaluation

## 📋 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between physiological signals—specifically **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** and **Beats Per Minute (BPM)**—and an individual's state of **hunger vs. satiety**. We collect data using the **Apple Watch** and aim to develop a predictive model for detecting these internal states based on biosignals.

## 💡 Motivation

Understanding how our physiological signals change between hunger and satiety could help build smarter wellness tracking tools. This project investigates whether biometric signals collected passively via Apple Watch can reveal insights into eating-related states.

## 📱 Data Collection

- Device: **Apple Watch**
- Data Types: 
  - HRV (Heart Rate Variability)
  - BPM (Heart Rate)
- Data Export: Use the **Health app on iPhone** to export Apple Health data (XML or CSV format)

## ⚙️ Software Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
